VERSE 1
Yesterday, we realized
That this life is not given
But history can tell that -- We'll Rise
Let's all look up in the skies
and we'll all be forgiven
 And the times we spent are not -- white lies

BRIDGE
We are children of the past
wandering around this town
We’re the voice of the outcast
And we will never back down

CHORUS
And we will sing together -- ONE LAST TIME
And we will laugh together -- ONE LAST TIME
And we will dream together -- ONE LAST TIME
And we will live together -- ONE LAST TIME

VERSE 2
And today, we realized
that this time is not given
And the future can tell that -- We rised
Let's all look up in the skies
and we shall be forgiven
 And the times we spent are not -- all lies

BRIDGE
We were children of the past
wandering around this town
We’re the voice of the outcast
And we have never backed down

CHORUS
And we will sing together -- ONE LAST TIME
And we will laugh together -- ONE LAST TIME
And we will dream together -- ONE LAST TIME
And we will live together -- ONE LAST TIME

OUTRO
ONE LAST TIME (repeated)

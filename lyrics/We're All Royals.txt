VERSE 1
Born in a cage
They think they’re rich
They don’t own the stage

I got the crown
I’m not a grinch
We won’t leave this town

BRIDGE
We are not on our own
I’ve got the red throne

We are not giving up
They’re not our backup

CHORUS
We will always live tomorrow
We’ll show our flames


We will never have any doubt
Around Winter

When the time comes in the Nightfall
We’re All Royals

VERSE 2
Left in the night
They think we’re down
They don’t own our right

I got the key
Of my hometown
We are history

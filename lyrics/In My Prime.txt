INTRO
This is my Time.

VERSE 1
Living in the night
And I forgot to think
I'm on another drink
My future isn't bright 

Breathing in the day
And I wanted to see
if I can be free
Maybe I'll get to stay

CHORUS
And I will live tonight
to give up my mind
And I will keep the fight
and clear up my mind

While I'm not in my prime
This might be my time

VERSE 2
Trying to go by
And I forgot to think
Never on a drink
I need to say goodbye

You are in my mind
And I wanted to be
Yet another flea
I need to stay behind

CHORUS
And I will live tonight
to give up my mind
And I will keep the fight
and clear up my mind

While I'm not in my prime
This might be my time

CHORUS
And I will live tonight
to take back my mind
And I will keep the fight
and clear up my mind

While I'm now in my prime
This is not my time

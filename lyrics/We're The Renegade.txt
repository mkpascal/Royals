CHORUS
We're Survivor of this Decade 
And We're Not Afraid
Let's Run and Grab the Red Grenade
We're the Renegade 
 
VERSE 1
I will not be living in fear
From another bad red queen
Leaving this town in the leap year
We'll not give up 'til we're clear

BRIDGE
We're all the same without a name
Give up one life in this town
We're all the pawns in this board game
But we will never back down
  
VERSE 2
I will not be living this down
And be the one to be strong
I leave my faith in no ghost town
And we'll never play along

PART 1
We are not ... dreaming in harmony
Walking down ... another broken street
A gunshot ... everything's so heavy
In this town ... I'm just another creep

Remember ... we'll never get older
We will all ... forget we have a path
Moving on ... and not finding closure
In this life... We will all laugh and crash

Random Cards ... we are not in control
Holding on ... to a past we don't want
They all said ... we'll have to sell our soul
But we're not ... ready to just get shot


PART 2
When the rich gets the sky
When the sky falls on you
It's the life of a lie
which we cannot argue

Can we all try to change?
Can we all take a risk?
It's time to turn the page
and to write a new script

Time for us to rewind
To another kingdom
We will now leave tonight
The end has just begun


PART 3
Is it my destiny?
To rule but not to live
Without any money
We are all living lies

At the top of the world
It's hard to see the ground
I'll give my best effort
In my heart there's no doubt

Today will be the day
Take back what we gave up
Walking to a Stairway
Leading to a Shortcut

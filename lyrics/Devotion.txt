VERSE 1
My mind hasn’t been the same
Living in this world rent free
I’ve been taking all the blame
Let me give you the right key

BRIDGE
I wanna be the one
You wanna be the last
Let’s fall into the sun

CHORUS
Lead the life you should lead
Don’t let this be unsaid
Get back your memory
Give me your remedy
Let’s set this in motion
I want this devotion 

VERSE 2 
Your love is another game
And you’re just too blind to see
You’ve been taking all the blame
Let me bring you the right key
